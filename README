PyRiemann - Riemann (http://aphyr.github.com/riemann/) Client for Python

This is a work in progress. Basically it's sending messages and queries for now.
Check the example directory for both tcp and udp samples. there's a port of riemann-check to python using the psutil library.

No need to create the protocol buffer classes, but in any case I've put a Makefile and a copy of proto.proto in the protobuf folder

TODO: async reponses, connection pool, twisted port (all of them really easy as the protocol is simple)
The twisted driver is work in progress
