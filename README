PyRiemann - Riemann (http://aphyr.github.com/riemann/) Client for Python

This is a work in progress. Basically it's sending messages and queries for now.
Check the example directory for both tcp and udp samples.

No need to create the protocol buffer classes, but in any case I've put a Makefile and a copy of proto.proto in the protobuf folder

TODO: gevent transport and async reponses, connection pool, twisted port (all of them really easy as the protocol is simple)
